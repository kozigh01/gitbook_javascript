There are a few different ways to run javascript code:

1. Clone the repository containing the code and run node at terminal:

    ```text
    >git clone https://github.com/kozigh01/es6-iterators-generators.git
    >cd es6-iterators-generators
    >node <filename>.js
    ```

2. Run the code in Chrome Dev Tools:

    1. Launch Chrome and open Dev Tools \(F12\)
    2. Click on "Sources" tab
    3. Open "Snippets" tab \(may need to click '&gt;&gt;' to see "Snippets" tab\)
    4. Click "+ New snippet" and choose a name
    5. Copy and paste javascript code into the new snippet
    6. Click the "Ctrl+Enter" button at the bottom of the snippet editor to run the script in the context of the current page
    7. To run the script again, hit the browser reload button and then the "Ctrl-Enter" button again
    8. Breakpoints can be set in the script file

3. Run the code in visual studio via an html file and use the Live Server plugin
    1. Create an html file with script tag
    2. While in the editor for that html file, click on the "Go Live" icon in the bottom status bar
    3. Live Server will serve the file and open the browser to that html page
